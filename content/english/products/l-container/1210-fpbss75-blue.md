  1. These large pallet boxes support stacking storage and work with pallet jacks, forklifts, and automated warehouses. They are widely used in food processing, cold-chain distribution, chemicals, warehousing, logistics, and manufacturing to safeguard bulk materials and packaged goods in storage and transport.

  2. The one-piece structural design resists impacts, cleans easily, and withstands moisture, low temperatures, acids, and alkalis. It meets international logistics standards and helps reduce warehouse and freight costs while keeping contents protected.

  3. Exceptional load performance: dynamic load capacity reaches 1,000–1,500 kg, and static load capacity reaches 4,000–6,000 kg. Every model undergoes stacking and durability tests, offering a longer service life and greater safety than wooden boxes with no fumigation required for export.

  4. With 20 years of experience in plastic manufacturing, we have served over 1,000 medium and large enterprises, ensuring product quality and on-time delivery to support your supply chain.
