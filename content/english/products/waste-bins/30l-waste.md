  1. The impact-resistant, UV-stable body resists fading and cracking, while the tight lid contains odors and keeps pests out. Smooth inner surfaces rinse clean quickly to maintain hygiene for long-term outdoor use.

  2. Options include a foot pedal, lid lock, drain plug, or RFID tag, and the bin is compatible with lifter combs for efficient tipping. Reinforced axles and low-noise wheels roll smoothly to reduce operator effort.

  3. Suitable for municipal sanitation, residential communities, campuses, industrial parks, and scenic areas. Supports color coding, logo printing, and sorting streams such as recyclables, organics, and residual waste.
