  Made from food-grade HDPE, this utility bin offers excellent impact resistance and long service life. The smooth inner surface is easy to rinse and helps prevent residue and odors. Its open, box-shaped design allows quick access to contents, making it suitable for handling fruits and vegetables, ingredients, small parts, tools and other everyday items. Reinforced rims provide a secure grip, and the bins can be stacked or nested to save floor and shelf space. Resistant to low temperatures and common cleaning agents, it is a practical choice for back-of-house kitchens, processing rooms, retail handling and household use.
