  These low-profile mesh trays can be stacked directly or paired with carts and racks, spanning lengths from a few dozen centimeters up to around 900 mm to move smoothly through freezers, drying rooms, and processing lines. Smooth reinforced rims prevent warping, support stable stacking, and keep ingredients or packaged items ventilated for quick draining.

  The one-piece body is low-temperature tolerant, easy to sanitize, and resistant to acids and alkalis for high-frequency reuse. Color, mesh, and size options can be customized to align with your workflow zoning and fast turnarounds.
