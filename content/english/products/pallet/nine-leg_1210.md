detail_intro: |-
  1. These pallets feature a lightweight design that makes them easy to handle. The 9-leg structure supports four-way forklift entry and is widely used in food processing, pharmaceuticals, fresh food distribution and carton packaging. With a high cost-performance ratio, they are an economical choice at about one third the weight of wooden pallets, reducing operator fatigue and significantly improving handling and turnover efficiency. 
  
  2. The pallets stack securely: the upper pallet nests smoothly into the base of the lower pallet, saving up to 70% of storage space for empty pallets.
  
  3. These pallets are water-, moisture- and corrosion-resistant, insect-proof and easy to clean. They require no fumigation for export and contain no splinters or exposed nails, helping protect both goods and personnel.
  
  4. For over 20 years, we have specialized in manufacturing plastic pallets, serving more than 1,000 medium and large enterprises. We ensure consistent quality and on-time delivery, and we welcome you to partner with us as a distributor.
