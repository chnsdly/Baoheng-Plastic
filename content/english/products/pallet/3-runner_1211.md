  1. These pallets are suitable for racking and stacking, and compatible with hand pallet jacks, electric forklifts and automated high-bay warehouses. They are widely used in food, chemical, cold chain and warehouse logistics industries, meeting most storage and transportation needs.
  
  2. The plastic pallets are one-piece molded with no weak points. They are easy to clean, moisture-resistant, low-temperature resistant and resistant to acids and alkalis, and comply with international logistics and transportation standards.
  
  3. With very high load capacity, the pallets offer a dynamic load of 1,500 kg for safe handling in transit and a static load of 6,000 kg, certified for heavy-duty racking storage. They last significantly longer than wooden pallets, require no fumigation for export, and meet strict safety standards.
  
  4. We have specialized in plastic pallet manufacturing for over 20 years, serving more than 1,000 medium and large enterprises. We ensure consistent quality and on-time delivery.
