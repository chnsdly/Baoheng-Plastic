  1. The industrial heavy-duty plastic pallet for printing presses is designed for continuous-feed systems and is compatible with Heidelberg CX74, CD74, XL-74, 75, SX74, as well as Roland 200, 300, 500, Rapid 74, 74G, Diamond 1000, Diamond 2000, and other automated printing lines. It serves as a dedicated support device to hold and stabilize printed materials during operation. The pallet features four-way entry, rounded safety corners, and a reinforced base for superior strength and stability. It is widely used in the printing, packaging, and manufacturing industries.

  2. These plastic pallets support loads of up to 1 ton and are built for long-term durability. Their robust construction allows them to withstand demanding environments and continuous high-intensity operation, making them an ideal choice for printing and manufacturing lines that require uninterrupted workflows.

  3. Our pallets meet international export standards and can be used for overseas shipments without additional treatment. They are engineered for direct export—no fumigation or heat treatment required—simplifying logistics and eliminating potential delays in the supply chain.

  4. Made from high-density polyethylene (HDPE), these pallets offer exceptional durability while remaining environmentally friendly. HDPE is known for its high strength-to-density ratio, making it ideal for long-life industrial products. It is also fully recyclable, helping reduce environmental impact and supporting your company’s sustainability goals.
