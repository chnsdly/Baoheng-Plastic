  1. These foldable pallet boxes support stacking storage and are compatible with pallet jacks, forklifts, and automated warehouses. They are widely used in food processing, cold-chain distribution, chemicals, warehousing, logistics, and manufacturing, meeting the needs of bulk materials and packaged goods in storage and transportation.
  
  2. The one-piece structural design ensures durability with no weak joints. The container is impact-resistant, easy to clean, moisture-proof, low-temperature tolerant, and resistant to acids and alkalis. It complies with international logistics standards, and the collapsible design greatly reduces warehouse space and return freight costs.
  
  3. With excellent load-bearing performance, dynamic load capacity reaches 1,000–1,500 kg, and static load capacity reaches 4,000–6,000 kg. All models are tested for stacking strength and long-term durability. Compared with wooden boxes, it offers a longer service life, enhanced safety, and is exempt from fumigation for export shipments.
  
  4. With 20 years of expertise in plastic container manufacturing, we have served over 1,000 medium and large enterprises, ensuring reliable quality and on-time delivery for your supply chain operations.
