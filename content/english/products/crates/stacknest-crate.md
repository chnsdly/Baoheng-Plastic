detail_intro: |-
  Injection-molded from impact-resistant HDPE, the ventilated crate is strong, durable and easy to clean, making it ideal for fresh produce, food ingredients and small parts. The metal bail handles provide a secure grip when folded out, allowing safe manual lifting and short-distance transport. When folded in, they lock against the rim to create a stable stacking support, helping protect the contents while reducing storage and return freight space. The crate withstands low temperatures and common detergents, making it suitable for cold-chain logistics, central kitchens, supermarkets and factory material handling.
