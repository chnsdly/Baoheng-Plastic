  The container is rotationally/injection molded in one piece from virgin material for excellent impact resistance and long service life. Smooth inner walls are easy to clean and help maintain hygiene in applications involving potable water or food ingredients. Structural ribs and a wide load-bearing base allow the tank to hold large volumes of liquid or bulk solids without deformation during daily use. Multiple footprints and capacities can be combined with trolleys, dollies or pallets for efficient handling. It is ideal for central kitchens, food plants, cold-chain processing, farms, aquaculture, workshops and light chemical use.
