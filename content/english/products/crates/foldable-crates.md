  The folding crate is molded from impact-resistant HDPE for a strong, rigid structure that resists deformation in daily use. Ventilated side walls provide airflow and drainage, making it suitable for fresh produce, supermarket distribution, industrial parts and general logistics. Integrated corner latches link the panels together so the crate can be quickly opened or collapsed with a single pull and push, without any tools. Once folded, the crate’s height is only about one-sixth of its full size, allowing compact nesting and multi-layer stacking. This significantly reduces empty-trip volume and warehouse footprint, making it ideal for high-frequency circulation and cost-conscious, space-efficient logistics operations.
