## Background

The customer is a Tier-1 automotive parts manufacturer in North China operating a 24-meter AS/RS. The system processes roughly 1,800 inbound and 1,500 outbound pallets per day using stacker cranes and AGVs. Loads consist of metal totes, with single-pallet weights of 700–900 kg.

## Challenges

1. **Insufficient racking-load capacity** on standard pallets led to excessive mid-span deflection.
2. **AGV stability issues** caused by low base rigidity and minor pallet rocking.
3. **Tight dimensional tolerance** required for AS/RS alignment and error-free handling.

## Solution

### 1. Reinforced pallet design
- 1200×1000 mm 3-runner pallets with three steel reinforcements.
- One-piece injection-molded high-stiffness material with controlled tolerances.
- Strengthened fork-entry geometry for stable stacker-crane handling.

### 2. Racking-load and beam spacing matching
- Calculated racking load using 1000 mm beam spacing as baseline.
- Target racking load: 1000 kg with a 1.2 safety factor.
- Optimized load distribution to prevent off-center placement.

### 3. AGV compatibility tuning
- Bottom flatness controlled within ±2 mm.
- Added guide blocks at AGV transfer points for consistent fork angles.
- Introduced incoming QC standards to maintain batch consistency.

## Results (first 3 months)

- **60% reduction in stacker-crane alarms** due to improved pallet stability.
- **~10% faster picking and replenishment cycles** from smoother AGV travel.
- **Beam deflection kept within specification**, eliminating previous over-limit incidents.
- **Batch consistency stabilized** and handling errors were largely eliminated.

## Lessons for peers

1. **In high-bay systems, racking load is the key metric**, not just dynamic load.
2. **AS/RS and AGV operations demand tight tolerances**—control flatness and consistency at the pallet level.
3. **Load placement matters**; off-center loads amplify deflection and alarms.

For high-bay projects, early pallet selection and load validation significantly reduce operational risk and long-term maintenance cost.
