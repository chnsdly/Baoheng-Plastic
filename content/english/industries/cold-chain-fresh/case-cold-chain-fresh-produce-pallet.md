## Summary

A regional cold-chain operator in North China serving supermarkets and community group buying struggled with warped pallets, frequent zone changes, and time-consuming sanitation. The project centered on frost-resistant plastic pallets, visible zoning labels, and segmented workflows, paired with washing and stacking adjustments to keep circulation steady. After rollout, breakage and scrap ranges narrowed, loading rhythm and temperature consistency improved directionally, and the customer chose to scale the same pallet type.

## Background

The customer runs origin consolidation sites and urban micro-fulfillment hubs across two provinces, dispatching trucks in the tens per day. SKUs include leafy greens, fruit, and portioned meat, with temperature zones spanning 0–4°C chilled and -18°C frozen. Pallets cycle through cold rooms, ambient sorting, and intercity trunk lines, bearing finished cartons and mixed replenishment. The warehouse lead noted, “In rainy or snowy weeks, wooden pallets kept absorbing water and crushed the bottom veggie boxes.”

## Challenges

1. **Temperature swings and condensation**: Moving pallets between cold rooms and ambient sorting caused surface moisture that softened cartons and hurt stack stability.
2. **Breakage and debris contamination**: Old wooden pallets cracked and chipped in frozen areas, raising food-safety concerns and forcing forklift detours.
3. **Sanitation effort and long drying**: Limited washing capacity meant repeatedly cleaned pallets stayed damp and slowed circulation.
4. **Inconsistent throughput**: Mixed pallet sizes made stack heights unpredictable, truck fill rates fluctuated, and trunk dispatch slots kept shifting.
5. **Weak traceability and zoning discipline**: Pallets circulated across zones and routes without clear batch history, blurring washing priorities.

## Goals

- Bring pallet scrap/repair proportions down to roughly one-half to two-thirds of prior levels to avoid sudden shortages.
- Tighten the rhythm between cold-store in/outbound and sorting so single-truck loading variance shrinks to about half of previous swings.
- Shorten sanitation waiting time without adding headcount, making pallet cycles more predictable.
- Build a traceable label system that roughly restores each pallet’s last temperature zone and batch.

## Solution Design

### Packaging unit and load
- 1200×1000 mm 3-runner plastic pallets with low-temperature polyethylene for toughness in the cold.
- Reinforced ribs along load paths to match a 600–900 kg distributed load range, avoiding brittle failures.
- Anti-slip pads to reduce carton sliding when condensation appears.

### Carrier and circulation
- Four-way entry for narrow cold-room aisles and truck tail-lifts.
- Two pallet variants: “frozen only” and “chilled/ambient mixed,” separated by color for fast sorting.
- Standard stack heights set by SKU profile before dispatch; drivers only confirm film integrity before departure.

### In-warehouse flow
- A short staging buffer at cold-room exits lets pallets temper for 5–8 minutes before sorting to curb condensation shock.
- After picking, pallets go straight to a pre-cool lane for loading, avoiding long ambient dwell time.
- Forklift routes were adjusted to cut cross-traffic, combined with color-based lane segregation.

### Washing and disinfection
- Washing cadence by zone: frozen-only pallets cleaned every 1–2 weeks in batches; others sampled per return lot.
- Added removable drainage holes to shorten drying time.
- Washing records attached to pallet sides on a weekly cycle to prevent duplicate or missed cleaning.

### Cold-room compatibility
- Slight chamfers on pallet runners to reduce snagging on frost or film ice.
- Pallet orientation aligned with rack beam spacing, forming a “load + pallet + rack” pairing checklist.
- Reserved buffer space inside the cold room to avoid overstacking that blocks airflow.

### Traceability and labeling
- Low-temperature QR labels per pallet batch, storing purchase batch, last washing week, and last temperature zone.
- Scanned on return to build coarse usage counts, guiding wash priority or retirement.

### People and SOP
- Forklift operators trained on plastic pallet behavior in the cold—no single-tip impacts or hard ramming.
- Pickers stage pallets by color and label to prevent frozen-only units from sitting in ambient areas too long.
- Sanitation teams schedule by week; during extended wet weather they log extra drying time.

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Pilot verification (Weeks 1–2)**: Deployed a small batch on two routes to watch low-temperature toughness and stack stability. This limited-risk phase let the team observe fragile fruit first; the warehouse supervisor remarked, “Start with the delicate SKUs and see if any dents or slips show up.” Risk: small sample may miss edge cases.
2. **Scaled deployment and label go-live (Weeks 3–6)**: After materials proved stable, replaced frozen-zone pallets in waves and applied low-temp labels with system entry. Goal: build a minimum viable pool; risk: legacy pallets not recovered, causing mix-ups.
3. **Flow and tempering adjustment (Weeks 7–10)**: Added tempering buffers at cold exits and rerouted forklifts based on pilot data. Benefit: less condensation and congestion; risk: if tempering drifts, loading can be delayed.
4. **Sanitation cadence tuning (Weeks 11–14)**: Added drainage racks in the wash area and scheduled by scan data. Risk: in rainy seasons, insufficient drying may require extra fans.
5. **Review and expansion decision (Week 15)**: Compared breakage, loading variance, and wash wait times; the customer opted to extend the pallet model to other routes while keeping a small wooden reserve for contingencies. Risk: execution gaps across sites, requiring audits.

## Results and Improvements

- **Breakage and scrap**: Frozen-zone pallet breakage/scrap ranged about 40%–60% lower than the old wooden baseline, with fewer sudden shortages.
- **Loading rhythm**: Standard stacks cut single-truck loading variance to roughly half of prior swings, making trunk dispatch more predictable and reducing dock idle time.
- **Hygiene and temperature control**: Carton collapse from condensation dropped noticeably; wash waiting times shortened; temperature deviations at cold-room entry/exit narrowed.
- **Traceability clarity**: Label scans show recent temperature zones and washing cycles, helping schedule rotation or retirement.
- **Ongoing tweaks**: Extra anti-slip mats and drying fans were added in wet or snowy weeks; the team plans to add simple cycle counters in labels later.

## Takeaways

1. **Low-temperature toughness and surface grip must go together**: Anti-frost materials prevent cracking, but condensation demands friction aids like pads or texture.
2. **Tempering buffers are a low-cost risk reducer**: A few minutes at the cold exit cuts carton softening and forklift slips.
3. **Labels and color codes are the simplest traceability tools**: Before complex systems, cold-resistant labels and zoning colors already clarify wash and zone priorities.
4. **Wash cadence should flex with weather**: Extend drying time in wet/high-humidity seasons to avoid residual moisture freezing on the floor.
5. **Keep a small contingency pool**: Retaining some legacy pallets during transition lowers operational friction when unexpected surges occur.
